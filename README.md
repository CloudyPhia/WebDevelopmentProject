# Full Stack Web Development Project

This is my full-stack web development project! The code is primarily from myself and a partner, though some samples/inspiration were pulled from CPSC 310 course material. This project allows users to query metadata from around UBC campus so that users can easily work with courses, prerequisites, course averages, and room scheduling!

My partner and I worked on this project in development sprints and we both put in an equal amount of work into the frontend and backend. The backend is primarily in TypeScript while the frontend uses JS, HTML, and CSS. 

To run, enter "yarn start" in the terminal of IntelliJ Ultimate and go to the address "http://localhost:4321". You can upload your UBC course metadata dataset and then perform queries! 

Have fun! :)
